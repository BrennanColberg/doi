## more of a technical list

- automatically extract title/author/abstract/pdf/etc for each DOI
  - download pdf locally in frontend maybe? to use the user's academic credentials
- basic db to persist messages (= { email, doi, text, timestamp })
- messaging mvp: channel-style sequential messages. no threads/etc to start
- basic email login system (restrict to edu / ban common email providers?)
- email notifications to previous chatters whenever someone responds
  - this may get spammy if everything's in one channel
- make discussions threadable (tree-like, similar to reddit/twitter)
- automatically extract emails of authors, add to notifs for viral growth
- get actual domain
- release chrome extension
- like/dislike system
- write homepage that explains the whole thing
